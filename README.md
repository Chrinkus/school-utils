# School Utilities

These scripts take an export from a specific web app similar to the `example.csv` file in `/data`. When exporting, there are certain fields that are needed ONLY. The expected content includes:

- Org defined ID
- Last Name
- First Name
- Email
- Numeric value of significance

## marker

Extracts the useful data, discards the rest. Sorts lines and spaces fields nicely. Would recommend to a friend.

## emailer

TODO: Extract all emails into a comma-separated list for mass emailing.
